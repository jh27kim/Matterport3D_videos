/** @page cmake-integration Integration library usage with CMake
@brief Guide how to find and use Magnum integration libraries with CMake build system

@tableofcontents
@m_footernavigation

The logic is in module `FindMagnumIntegration.cmake` distributed in integration
repository in `modules/` directory, you are encouraged to copy it into your
project and add path to the files to `CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`. Otherwise, if CMake
won't be able to find this file in predefined locations, it will error out even
if Magnum integration libraries might be installed on the system.

Note that the module file is updated as the library evolves, you are encouraged
to update your copy from time to time to avoid strange building issues.

If you installed the library or its dependencies to non-standard location
(other than `/usr`, e.g. `/home/xyz/projects`), set `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to that
directory to help CMake find it. You can enter more different dirs if you
separate them with semicolons.

Basic usage is:

@code{.cmake}
find_package(MagnumIntegration REQUIRED)
@endcode

This command tries to find Magnum integration library and then defines:

-   `MagnumIntegration_FOUND` --- Whether the library was found

This command alone is useless without specifying the components:

-   `Bullet` --- @ref BulletIntegration library
-   `Eigen` --- @ref EigenIntegration library
-   `Dart`  --- @ref DartIntegration library
-   `Glm` --- @ref GlmIntegration library
-   `ImGui` --- @ref ImGuiIntegration library
-   `Ovr` --- @ref OvrIntegration library

Note that [each *Integration namespace](namespaces.html) contains more detailed
information about dependencies, availability on particular platform and also
guide how to enable given library in build and use it with CMake.

Example usage with specifying additional components is:

@code{.cmake}
find_package(MagnumIntegration REQUIRED Bullet)
@endcode

For each component is then defined:

-   `MagnumIntegration_*_FOUND` --- Whether the component was found
-   `MagnumIntegration::*` --- Component imported target

The package is found if either debug or release version of each requested
library is found. If both debug and release libraries are found, proper version
is chosen based on actual build configuration of the project (i.e. `Debug`
build is linked to debug libraries, `Release` build to release libraries).

See also @ref cmake "Magnum usage with CMake" for more information.

@section cmake-integration-modules Other CMake modules

The `modules/` directory contains more useful CMake modules:

-   `FindGLM.cmake` --- CMake module for finding the GLM library. Copy this to
    your module directory if you want to use the @ref GlmIntegration library.
-   `FindOVR.cmake` --- CMake module for finding the OVR SDK. Copy this to your
    module directory if you want to use the @ref OvrIntegration library.
-   `FindImGui.cmake` --- CMake module for finding Dear ImGui. Copy this to
    your module directory if you want to use the @ref ImGuiIntegration library.
