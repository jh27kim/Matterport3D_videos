@section changelog-integration-latest Changes since 2019.01

@subsection changelog-integration-latest-new New features

-   New @ref EigenIntegration library, providing conversion of math types from
    and to [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) APIs (see
    [mosra/magnum-integration#40](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/40))
-   New @ref ImGuiIntegration::imageButton() widget for drawing an image button
    out of @ref GL::Texture2D (see [mosra/magnum-integration#38](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/38))

@subsection changelog-integration-latest-changes Changes and improvements

-   @ref ImGuiIntegration::Context::handleKeyPressEvent() "ImGuiIntegration::Context::handleKey*Event()"
    now handles the @m_class{m-label m-default} **Space** key as well (see
    [mosra/magnum-integration#44](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/44))

@subsection changelog-integration-latest-buildsystem Build system

-   The `package/msys` directory now contains `PKGBUILD`s for
    [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/). See @ref building-integration-packages-msys
    for more information. See also [mosra/magnum-integration#39](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/39)
    and [mosra/magnum#317](https://github.com/mosra/magnum/pull/317).
-   If both a CMake-based ImGui installation is found and `IMGUI_DIR` is set
    when building, `FindImGui.cmake` prefers the location given by `IMGUI_DIR`
-   ES 2.0 and ES 3.0 subset of tests requiring GL context is now run on Travis
    CI using SwiftShader for better code coverage

@subsection changelog-integration-latest-bugfixes Bug fixes

-   The @ref ImGuiIntegration::image() widget was flipping the texture
    vertically (see [mosra/magnum-integration#38](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/38))

@subsection changelog-integration-latest-compatibility Potential compatibility breakages, removed APIs

-   Removed `BulletIntegration::convertShape()` as it was depending on the
    now-removed `Shapes` library, deprecated since 2018.10

@subsection changelog-integration-latest-documentation Documentation

-   @ref ImGuiIntegration::Context now mentions possible pitfalls when
    supplying in-memory fonts to ImGui (see
    [mosra/magnum-integration#42](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/issues/42))

@section changelog-integration-2019-01 2019.01

Released 2019-02-04, tagged as
[v2019.01](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/releases/tag/v2019.01).

@subsection changelog-integration-2019-01-dependencies Dependency changes

-   Minimal supported GCC version is now 4.8.1, GCC 4.7 is not supported
    anymore. Minimal Clang version is now 3.3, since that's the first version
    with a complete C++11 support. See also
    [mosra/magnum#274](https://github.com/mosra/magnum/issues/274).
-   Minimal supported CMake version is now 3.1. Older versions are not
    supported anymore and all workarounds for them were removed. Download a
    prebuilt release of a newer version if you need to use Corrade on older
    systems (such as Ubuntu 14.04 or Debian 8). See also
    [mosra/magnum#274](https://github.com/mosra/magnum/issues/274).

@subsection changelog-integration-2019-01-new New features

-   New @ref ImGuiIntegration library to render
    [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) user interfaces (see
    [mosra/magnum-integration#33](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/33)
    and [mosra/magnum#36](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/issues/36))

@subsection changelog-integration-2019-01-bugfixes Bug fixes

-   Conversion of 3x3 matrices in the @ref BulletIntegration was transposing
    them by mistake. This was only discoverable if the transformation of
    objects attached to @ref BulletIntegration::MotionState included rotation.
    See also [mosra/magnum-integration#34](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/34).

@subsection changelog-integration-2019-01-deprecated Deprecated APIs

-   The `Magnum/OvrIntegration/Conversion.h` header name was not consistent
    with other libraries and thus is deprecated, use
    @ref Magnum/OvrIntegration/Integration.h instead

@subsection changelog-integration-2019-01-compatibility Potential compatibility breakages, removed APIs

-   Removed `MAGNUM_*INTEGRATION_LIBRARIES` and `MAGNUM_*INTEGRATION_INCLUDE_DIRS`
    CMake variables, which were deprecated in favor of `MagnumIntegration::*`
    imported targets in February 2016.

@subsection changelog-integration-2019-01-documentation Documentation

-   The @ref BulletIntegration::MotionState docs gave a false impression that
    the transformation update is two-way, while it is only from bullet to
    @ref SceneGraph. The docs are now clarified and suggest possible solutions.
    See also [mosra/magnum-integration#35](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/35).

@section changelog-integration-2018-10 2018.10

Released 2018-10-23, tagged as
[v2018.10](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/releases/tag/v2018.10).

@subsection changelog-integration-2018-10-new New features

-   New @ref GlmIntegration library that provides conversion and debug output
    for [GLM](https://glm.g-truc.net/) math types.

@subsection changelog-integration-2018-10-changes Changes and improvements

-   Updated the @ref OvrIntegration library to work with OVR SDK 1.17 and newer
    and adapted it to work with latest changes in the @ref GL library
    (see [mosra/magnum-integration#26](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/26)
    and [mosra/magnum-integration#32](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/32))
-   It's now possible to construct @ref BulletIntegration::DebugDraw without an
    active GL context using the @ref NoCreate tag

@subsection changelog-integration-2018-10-buildsystem Build system

-   There's now a PPA for Ubuntu packages. See @ref building-integration-packages-deb
    for more information. See also
    [mosra/magnum-integration#31](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/31).

@subsection changelog-integration-2018-10-bugfixes Bug fixes

-   Sometimes Bullet reports object transformation full of NaNs. Unsure what
    the real cause is but NaNs trigger an axis normalization assert in
    @ref Math::Matrix4::rotation(), so the @ref BulletIntegration::MotionState
    class is ignoring this case with a warning.

@subsection changelog-integration-2018-10-deprecated Deprecated APIs

-   `BulletIntegration::DebugDraw::DebugMode`, `DebugModes`, `mode()` and
    `setDebugMode()` are deprecated, use @ref BulletIntegration::DebugDraw::Mode,
    @ref BulletIntegration::DebugDraw::Modes "Modes",
    @ref BulletIntegration::DebugDraw::mode() "mode()" and
    @ref BulletIntegration::DebugDraw::setMode() "setMode()" instead. The
    @ref BulletIntegration::DebugDraw::Mode "Mode" and
    @ref BulletIntegration::DebugDraw::Modes "Modes" enums were deprecated by
    mistake in 2018.02, now they are revert back to non-deprecated state.
-   `BulletIntegration::DebugDraw::Mode::FastWirefram` has a typo and is
    deprecated, use @ref BulletIntegration::DebugDraw::Mode::FastWireframe
    instead

@section changelog-integration-2018-04 2018.04

Released 2018-05-01, tagged as
[v2018.04](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/releases/tag/v2018.04).

@subsection changelog-integration-2018-04-dependencies Dependency changes

-   Building for Android now requires CMake 3.7 with builtin Android
    crosscompilation support, the old toolchains were removed. Only the Clang
    and libc++ toolchain is now supported, support for GCC and libstdc++ was
    dropped, as it was still missing some important C++11 functionality. See
    @ref building-cross-android for more information.

@subsection changelog-integration-2018-04-changes Changes and improvements

-   Second experimental version of the @ref DartIntegration library ---
    `DartIntegration::DartObject` and `DartIntegration::DartSkeleton` got
    replaced with @ref DartIntegration::Object and @ref DartIntegration::World,
    which is now able to track updates to all shapes and propagate that to the
    user. See [mosra/magnum-integration#29](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/29),
    [mosra/magnum-integration#30](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/issues/30).

@subsection changelog-integration-2018-04-buildsystem Build system

-   Homebrew macOS packages were updated to install the stable version by
    default
-   Fixed the Debian package after introducing `SOVERSION` to all libraries
    (see [mosra/magnum#237](https://github.com/mosra/magnum/issues/237))
-   Fixed the Debian package to not include a revision. While just a warning on
    Ubuntu, it's a hard error on Debian. (See [mosra/corrade#44](https://github.com/mosra/corrade/issues/44).)

@section changelog-integration-2018-02 2018.02

    replacing the unmaintained and outdated Jenkins configuration
-   Support for CMake subprojects. You can now clone Magnum Plugins into a
    subdirectory in your project and add it using @cmake add_subdirectory() @ce.
    The @cmake find_package() @ce command will then use the CMake subproject
    instead of looking for it in system-wide locations.
